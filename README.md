My trivia app project showcases how to pull different items from an API, and map over them to create a list that is then converted into radio buttons. It uses ID'S for categories so I had to make sure that it was able not only to look for a certain category but to match it to an ID and return the ID so it would work. I used props and passed down components from the parent to the child. Including the main.jsx and the app.jsx, there are 5 components total. I feel like with this lesson I learned more about not just props but updating the DOM as well. I did some light styling mostly with bootstrap, but later on I might consider adding more styling! I learned too that there is built in styling with React, especially for responsiveness, because I was trying to do stuff with media queries and it wasn't working! But as I tried it without media queries and it worked just how I wanted it to work just using regular CSS. I wanted to keep the UI clean and nice looking, so instead of having an error message if they didn't fill out all the fields I just put a <p> saying that all fields are required and kept the button greyed out until they do so.

Overall I am happy with how this project came out!
